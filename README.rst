astropalmerio
===============
This python package regroups useful data analysis code that I've developped throughout my work.
These are mainly aimed towards astronomy-related topics but some modules (like Monte Carlo errors) may be useful to a wider audience.
This repository provides an easy way to version, package and distribute this code to colleagues, but anyone is welcome to use it.
If you have any questions, you can contact me at jesse.palmerio@obspm.fr.
